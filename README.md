# ML_Formulas
Formulas for activation functions, regulation functions, loss, accuracy in Python

# Need for a place to revise all the basics of Machine Learning

I being a machine learning engineer, and working in a computer vision project for the past two years, somehow down the lane I have lost my basic ml knowledge like, what is the forumla for accuracy(Precision,Recall,F1-Score) and other functions, as we are more habituated of using well known packages like sci-kit learn to do all the calculations for us.

I presume this is the problem that most of us so called "ML Engineers" are experiencing today. To help all of us revise the basics and relearn what we have unlearned, I have planned to build this repository. I kept this public for the major good, benifit of all of us.

I encourage you to go thourgh the my work that I present here and please provide your valued suggestions to improve the work.
